Todo:
    - Monochromatic colours.
    - Shades.
    - Tints.
    - Saving previously generated colours. (Since everything is derived from the primary colour, all we need to save is that one)
    - Exporting or saving palettes.
    - Maybe even the ability to load a previously saved palette.
    - The ability to select your own colour. (This was figured out in the colour blender, just bring that over)
